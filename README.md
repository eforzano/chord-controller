# chord-controller

The scope of the project is to build a one handed music controller. The left side of the controller has an array of chosen root notes assorted based on the circle of fifths. Once the root note is chosen, the controller allows you to pick notes from that scale using modifiers. 

This is documenting the progress of building a chord based music controller.
